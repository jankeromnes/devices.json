# Simulated Devices

`devices.json` is a catalog of common web-enabled devices and their properties, that was previously used by the Responsive Design Mode in Firefox DevTools.
The data now lives in Mozilla's RemoteSettings `devtools-devices` collection, see https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools/responsive/devices.html for more information.
